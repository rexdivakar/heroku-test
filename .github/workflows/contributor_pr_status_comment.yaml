            It looks like you haven't order the JSON values in **ascending order alphabetically ignoring case** by Github user name or your JSON syntax is wrong. Please read the issue description before taking them.

            If you know about nodejs run the following command to sort the list:
            ```sh
              npx sort-json contributors.json --ignore-case
            ```

            **If you don't know about node js, go the following link:**
            https://codeshack.io/json-sorter/
            Paste the content of the file and generate a sorted JSON. After the paste the sorted list in the file and make a commit.


            Once this is done, your PR will be reviewed and merged.
